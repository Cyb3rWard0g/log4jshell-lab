# Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Apache Log4j2

I wanted to learn more about the recent Log4j vulnerabilities, and even got asked to replicate some of the initial variations shared publicly. Creating a proof-of-concept was not as easy as I thought, because I was not as familiar with Log4j. I wanted to get a better understanding of the implementation of JNDI lookups in Log4j. However, I did not even know what Log4j was 😂. Therefore, I started to read [Log4j documentation](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html) and took several notes over a couple of days.

The following sections highlight initial docs that helped me a lot to get more familiarized with the technology and concepts behind `Log4Shell`. I am cleaning my research notes and sharing them here so that others can benefit if possible.

## Research Notes

* Understanding the Implementation of Technology
  * [Log4j and Lookups Overview](2021-12-10_01-log4j-and-lookups.md)
  * [JNDI Lookups](2021-12-10_02-log4j-jndi-lookup.md)

* Simulations
  * [CVE-2021-44228](2021-12-11_01-CVE-2021-44228-simulation.md)
  * [CVE-2021-45046](2022-01-03_01-CVE-2021-45046-simulation.md)

## Research Timeline

Having a timeline was and is still very useful to understand how we got here and explain some of the features that have been removed and added to the Log4j framework.

However, when the nested variable references the variable being replaced, the `recursion` is called with the `same string`. This leads to an infinite recursion and a DoS condition on the server. As an example, if the Pattern Layout contains a Context Lookup of `${ctx.apiversion}`, and its assigned value is `${${ctx.apiversion}}`, the variable will be recursively substituted with itself.</li><li>**Log4j 1.x is not impacted by this vulnerability**.</li><li>**Only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability**.</li></ul>|
